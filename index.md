Hello! My name is Matthew Yang, an udergraduate student at Cornell University studying Computer Science. I am very excited to be in ECE 4960 as I am pursuing a minor in robotics.  <br>
I am currently a part of the Cornell Baja project team, and am involved at Emmaus Road Church and the Cornell Men's Club Volleyball Team. Outside of school I like to fish, bike, cook, and play sports.
